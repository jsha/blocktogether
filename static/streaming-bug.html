  <h3>Blocked users appear in mentions on some clients</h3>

<p>
  There have been reports of blocked users showing up in some people's mentions on
  these clients: Tweetdeck, Twitter for Mac, Tweetbot, and Echofon. This is most
  likely because of two factors:
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>The Twitter user streams API
	<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/userstreams#filtering_tweet_for_display"
	>delivers mentions even for blocked users</a>. Clients are required to
	fetch the current list of blocks from <a
	href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/blocks/ids">/blocks/ids</a>
	and filter blocked users locally.
    </li>
    <li>The <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/blocks/ids">/blocks/ids</a>
	API call returns a maximum of 5000 blocked user ids. If there are more
	than 5000 blocked user ids, the client must implement cursoring to get the
	rest.</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>
It's likely that many streaming clients make a single call to /blocks/ids on
startup and do not implement cursoring for that call. In those clients, users
that block more than 5000 accounts may receive unwanted mentions from accounts
they block. The response from /blocks/ids happens to be ordered so that the first
5000 accounts returned are the most recently blocked, so the most recently blocked
accounts will be filtered and accounts blocked earlier won't be.
</p>

<p>
Clients that rely on the streaming API to deliver mentions should make sure to
implement cursoring on /blocks/ids to get the entire list.
</p>

<p>
Note that there is a rate limit of fifteen requests per fifteen minutes, so clients should
additionally make sure to handle a rate limit response (HTTP status code 429) by
retrying in fifteen minutes, otherwise a similar problem will arise for the rare
user who has more than 75,000 blocks. If you develop a client, email
blocktogether@lists.riseup.net and I can provide temporary access to a testing
account with &gt;75,000 blocks.
