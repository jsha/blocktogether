<p>Currently (2014-09-30), Block Together allows you to share block lists,
and block all users on a block list, but it <b>doesn't yet</b> allow you to
subscribe to block lists on an ongoing basis. Here is the planned functionality
for Block Subscriptions, to be implemented:</p>

<p>An author can share a list of accounts they think others should block. This list
must be a subset of accounts the author blocks.</p>

<p>An author can add and remove accounts from their list.</p>

<p>By default, when an author blocks accounts on Twitter, those accounts are added
to the author's shared block list.</p>

<p>When an author unblocks accounts on Twitter, those accounts are removed from the
author's shared block list.</p>

<p>An author can manually remove an account from their shared block list even though
they still block that account.</p>

<p>When creating a shared block list, an author can start with all their existing
blocks or start with an empty list. The latter will be gently encouraged to avoid
accidental inclusion of 'tedious and highly retweeted' accounts that are not
involved in harassment or abuse.</p>

<p>A subscriber can subscribe to shared block lists, up to a limit of 10
subscriptions. An author can have any number of subscribers.</p>

<p>When an author adds an account to their shared block list, that author's
subscribers auto-block that account.</p>

<p>Subscribers will not auto-block accounts they currently follow.</p>

<p>Subscribers <b>will</b> auto-block accounts that currently follow
them.</p>

<p>When an author removes an account from their shared block list, each of that
author's subscribers auto-unblocks the account, if:<ul>
 <li>the subscriber has never manually blocked the account, AND
 <li>the account is not on any other shared block lists subscribed to by the
   subscriber.</ul></p>

<p>If an author subscribes to other authors' block lists or uses one of the 'block
new accounts' features, account they auto-block through these mechanisms do not
get added to their shared block list.</p>

<p>If a account on a shared block list is suspended, deactivated, or deleted, that
account's user id remains on that shared block list indefinitely. If the
account is unsuspended or reactivated, anyone who newly subscribed to the
shared block list while that account was suspended or deactivated will block
them as soon as Block Together notices the reactivation.</p>

<p>A subscriber can view a list of authors whose shared block lists they subscribe to.</p>

<p>A subscriber can unsubscribe from an authors' block list. When they do this,
any accounts that the subscriber blocked solely because of that block list
will be unblocked.</p>

<p>An author can view a list of subscribers to their block list.</p>

<p>An author can remove individual subscribers to their block list. When they do
this, the subscribers do not auto-unblock the accounts that they blocked
via the author's block list.</p>

<p>An author can disable the sharing URL for their block list. When they do this,
they retain their subscribers, but are asked whether they would like to remove
those subscribers.</p>

<p>If the author of a shared block list is suspended, deactivated, or deleted,
their shared block list and list of subscribers are stored for 30 days, after
which they are deleted, unless the author has been unsuspended or reactivated
in the meantime.</p>

<p>If a subscriber is suspended, deactivated, or deleted, no auto-blocks are
attempted on their account until they are unsuspended or reactivated. When the
subscriber is unsuspended or reactivated, Block Together will retroactively
apply any auto-blocks that would have been applied.</p>

<h1>Technical Design</h1>

<p>Technical goals: Newly added blocks should be applied to subscriber accounts
relatively quickly. Downtime of the Block Together service should not cause
missed blocks - i.e. if shared block list authors block new accounts during down
time, those blocks should be distributed to subscribers when Block Together
comes back online.</p>

<p>It should be possible to construct at any time the exact set of accounts that
a subscriber should be auto-blocking based on their subscriptions, and apply
blocks or unblocks as necessary to make the subscriber's actual blocks on
Twitter match that list. There is a small amount of path-dependence here
because of the UX requirement that an author can force-unsubscribe a subscriber,
but the force-unsubscription does not trigger any unblocks on the subscriber's
account. Also we need to make sure not to unblock accounts that a subscriber has
manually blocked.</p>

<p>There will be a new Subscriptions table to record subscription
information.  It will have columns author_uid and subscriber_uid. We
would also like to record historical subscription data to make it easier
to debug any issues. In the user-facing code to add a subscription, we will
have to verify that the subscription request includes an authorization of some
sort. Initially this authorization will be the contents of the author's
shared_blocks_key. In future authorization may be provided by the
author setting their block list to public, or by a specific list of authorized
subscribers that the author provides.</p>

<p>To construct the should-be-blocked set for a subscriber, start with the union
of all the block lists they subscribe to. Subtract any accounts that the
subscriber currently blocks for any reason. Subtract any accounts that the
subscriber has ever manually unblocked (auto-unblocks do not count). Any
accounts remaining should be enqueued in the Actions list to be blocked,
with cause = 'subscription' and cause_uid = any author whose block list the
account is on.</p>

<p>If we naively enqueue a block action for each such account, some
of those blocks will be cancelled in the Actions system because the subscriber
is following the account to be blocked. This is fine, but it would result in a
loop of continually enqueueing fresh Actions, only to have them be cancelled
repeatedly. To avoid this, before enqueueing blocks, we should also subtract
accounts for which the subscriber has a previous cancelled Block
Action. More generally, we should subtract accounts for which the subscriber has
any past Block Action, unless that Action has status = 'done' and cause =
'subscription.' Ignoring Actions caused by subscriptions doesn't cause loops
because the subscriber would still be blocking the target account, unless the
subscriber had subsequently auto-unblocked it, in which case the account is fair
game to be auto-blocked again if the account is re-added to one of the
subscribed lists.</p>

<p>To construct the should-be-unblocked set for a subscriber, we want to
start with the set of all accounts the subscriber is currently blocking
due to their current subscriptions, and subtract the union of the block
lists they currently subscribe to. Since we only consider accounts the
subscriber blocks due to current subscriptions, this approach doesn't
auto-unblock accounts when a subscriber is force-unsubscribed from an author's list. To
get the set of all accounts the subscriber is currently blocking due to
their current subscriptions, we look at the Actions table for accounts
where the subscriber has a Block or Unblock Action with status = 'done'.
We group those actions by sink_uid and choose the most recent one. Of those, we
select the ones where type = 'block', cause = 'subscription', and
cause_uid = any author the subscriber currently subscribes to.</p>

<p>We are assuming that the Actions table records externally-observed
blocks and unblocks, which it doesn't yet. We could record these from
the Streaming API and/or by looking at the differences each time we
fetch someone's blocks from the REST API. Most likely we want both,
but the REST version should have priority since it is the best way to
be resilient to short downtimes. With the Streaming API, any blocks and
unblocks that happen while stream.js is not running get dropped on the
floor. With the REST API the only time we would fail to notice a block
or an unblock is if the action was executed and then reversed before
the next time we fetch updated blocks. The disadvantage of the REST API
is that we may not fetch updated blocks for up to 24 hours, and so the
timestamps on the actions may be misleading. In either case we need to be
aware that when Block Together takes an action, that action will also be
echoed back to us through the API. We should take care to collapse that
external action with any recently updated Actions marked as 'done'. There
may also be race conditions. It's possible that after executing a Block
Action, actions.js attempts to write the updated status for that Action
in the database, but that attempt gets put on an unusually long event
queue and is not executed for a few seconds. Meanwhile the event is
echoed back from the Streaming API and, finding only a pending action,
gets added to the Actions table. So both 'pending' and 'done' should
be collapsed with external actions. External actions will have cause =
'external', and cause_uid = none.</p>

<p>When determining block / unblock events via the REST API, we have to be aware
of suspensions and deactivations. If an author is blocking an account, and that
account is not listed next time we request blocks from the REST API, it could be
because the author unblocked the account, or because the account is now
suspended or deactivated. When calculating block diffs, we should make sure to
call /users/lookup for accounts that appear to have been added or removed. If
the lookup returns 404, we know the account was suspended or deactivated and shouldn't
be added as an Action. Similarly, an account may suddenly show up as blocked
when we request blocks, but that may only mean that the account was blocked and
deactivated, but recently reactivated. We have limited ability to detect this
situation, since accounts that an author blocked before signing up for Block
Together can later reactivate, looking like a recent block, but these are
probably fine.</p>

<p>Over time authors will block increasingly large chunks of accounts that are suspended or
deactivated. If we retain a record of these "ghost blocks" and incorporate them
into BlockBatches, we would need to call /users/lookup on every block update, even
if there was no change in the user's blocks. Instead, we should always treat a
BlockBatch as a simple representation of the latest results from the Twitter
REST API. That way, when a blocked account disappears from the next fetched
BlockBatch, we do the /users/lookup once to disambiguate suspension /
deactivation vs unblock, and we're done. The next fetched BlockBatch will also
not contain that user, so there will be no diff to check. After checking a diff,
we will insert a record of that diff in the Actions table and potentially in a
shared block list table. It's possible for Block Together to be restarted
between when we finish fetching a fresh BlockBatch and when we finish checking
any diffs. We should use the `complete' flag on BlockBatches to control for
this. A BlockBatch is not considered complete until all diffs have been checked
and stored as necessary. Storing the diffs an the `complete' flag should be done
in an SQL transaction to avoid inconsistency.</p>
