    Block Together will not tweet on your behalf, but it needs read/write
    access so it can block people when you ask it to. Twitter describes
    that permission as 'Post tweets for you.'

    Block Together is designed to reduce the burden of blocking when
    many accounts are attacking you, or when a few accounts are
    attacking many people in your community. It uses the Twitter
    API. If you choose to share your list of blocks, your friends
    can subscribe to your list so that when you block an account,
    they block that account automatically. You can also use Block
    Together without sharing your blocks with anyone.

    Block Together will never block an account you follow, even if it meets one
    of the above criteria.  Similarly, if Block Together incorrectly blocks an account, you can
    unblock that account on Twitter. Block Together will notice the
    fact and avoid blocking that account again in the future. Also,
    every time Block Together blocks someone, the event is recorded on the
    'Actions' tab, so you can check who's been blocked and fix any issues.

    If you subscribe to a block list, you will block every account currently on
    that list. Later, if the author of that block list blocks more
    accounts, you will automatically block those as well. If the author of the
    list unblocks an account, you will automatically unblock it too, but
    only if you originally blocked it through the shared list. If you blocked
    the account independently, it will not be unblocked.

    </a>
    <p>
    If you choose to share your block list with friends, Block Together will
    create an unlisted, unguessable URL to access your block list. You can share
    the URL by email or Direct Message if you want to keep it private among
    friends, or you can tweet the URL if you are okay sharing your block list
    publicly. You can always disable sharing from the Settings page. If you do
    so, the URL to access your blocks will be deleted forever. If you choose to
    share again in the future, you will create a new, different URL.
    If you choose to disable sharing, you need to separately remove any
    subscribers you no longer want, on the Subscriptions page.
    </p>

    <p>
    Many people find that they don't want to share their block list because they
    find there are accounts on it they don't remember blocking, or that aren't
    particularly abusive. This is partly because Twitter, for a long time, did
    not offer Mute. So if you wanted to stop seeing a merely unfunny account
    that gets frequently retweeted, blocking used to be the only fix. Now
    Twitter offers Mute, so you can Mute those accounts instead. Block Together
    makes it easy to remove them from your shared block list with the
    'Unblock and Mute' button on the My Blocks page.

    Block Together only blocks accounts, it never reports them for spam or
    abuse. Adding an account to your shared block list will not cause that
    account to be suspended. People whose accounts get suspended can <a
    href="https://support.twitter.com/articles/15790-my-account-is-suspended"
    >contact Twitter Support for more information</a>. An account that uses a
    block list is not hidden or protected in any way from blocks, abuse reports,
    or suspensions.

    <p>
    The largest size of a shared block list is 250,000 accounts. If your
    blocklist is larger than this, new people will not be able to subscribe to
    it. If you remove some accounts from your block list to get it below
    250,000, people will be able to subscribe to it again.
