  <p>
  This page shows whose block lists you subscribe to, and who subscribes to your
  block list, if you have chosen to share one. You can unsubscribe from a shared
  block list by clicking the
  <span class="unsubscribe glyphicon glyphicon-remove"></span> next to the
  screen name. Note: Unsubscribing does not currently unblock everyone from the
  list.
  </p>

  <p>
  By default, subscriptions continue even when you make your shared block list
  inaccessible using the <a href='/settings'>Settings page</a>. Once you've made
  your shared block list inaccessible, you can also force unsubscribe people
  using this interface. Note that if your shared block list is still accessible,
  those people can choose to re-subscribe.
  </p>
