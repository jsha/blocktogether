 * Validation is a little tricky.  We want to check whether a given
 * user is blocking the target. The relevant endpoint is friendships/lookup,
 * https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/friendships/lookup.
 * That endpoint has a rate limit of 15 requests per 15 minutes, which means
 * bulk blocking would proceed very slowly if we called it once per block
 * action.
 *
 * However, friendships/lookup supports bulk querying of up to 100 users at
 * once. So we organize the validation by source_uid. In short: for every BtUser
 * in the database, get up to 100 of their oldest pending blocks, ask Twitter
 * (in bulk) whether the source_uid follows the sink_uid, and if not then
 * proceed with the blocks. Note that the block endpoint can only block one user
 * at a time, but it does not appear to have a rate limit.
 *
 * When a block action is completed, set its state to DONE. When a block
 * action is cancelled because the source_uid follows the sink_uid, set its
 * state to CANCELLED_FOLLOWING.
